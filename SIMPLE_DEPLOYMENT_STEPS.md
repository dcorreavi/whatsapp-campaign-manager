# Simple GitHub & Railway Deployment

## Step 1: Use Replit's Version Control Panel

1. Look for the **Version Control** icon (git symbol) in Replit's left sidebar
2. Click "Create Git Repository" 
3. Click "Connect to GitHub"
4. Name your repository: `whatsapp-campaign-manager`
5. Push your code directly from Replit

If that doesn't work, try the manual approach:

## Step 2: Manual GitHub Setup

### Create Repository on GitHub:
1. Go to github.com/new
2. Repository name: `whatsapp-campaign-manager`
3. Make it public
4. DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
5. Click "Create repository"

### Upload Files Manually:
1. On the empty repository page, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Upload these key files from Replit:
   - package.json
   - All files from client/ folder
   - All files from server/ folder  
   - All files from shared/ folder
   - tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts, tailwind.config.ts, drizzle.config.ts
   - The README.md, .gitignore, railway.toml files I created

## Step 3: Deploy on Railway

1. Go to railway.app
2. Login with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" â†’ "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select `whatsapp-campaign-manager`
5. Railway auto-detects Node.js and deploys

### Set Environment Variables in Railway:
- `DATABASE_URL` (Railway provides PostgreSQL)
- `NODE_ENV=production`

## Your App Will Be Live!

The WhatsApp Campaign Manager will be fully functional with:
- PostgreSQL database (persistent storage)
- Complete campaign workflow
- Demo WhatsApp integration (logs to console)
- Professional UI with real-time progress tracking

Railway supports browser automation, so you can later enable real WhatsApp messaging by installing whatsapp-web.js in production.
